# RAG-based-AI-gent-for-Sales-Support
RAG and/or knowledge-based AI agent application. The application will be used to support our sales team and be used to generate proposals, documents, and communications. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in AI technologies and Gen AI development, have a proven track record of AI project deliveries, and be able to work with an established development team. The app is to be developed in Python, use an off the shelf front end delivery system like Streamlit, and be hosted in Google Cloud. If you have a passion for AI and a track record of successful projects, we would love to hear from you!
==================
Here's a Python code example for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge-based AI agent application. This example includes core functionalities such as integrating AI-based knowledge retrieval, proposal/document generation, and a user interface powered by Streamlit. The application is designed for deployment on Google Cloud.
Python Code for RAG-Based AI Agent for Sales Support
1. Set Up Environment

Install the required libraries:

pip install streamlit openai langchain chromadb google-cloud-storage google-cloud-firestore

2. Knowledge Base and RAG Functionality

This code integrates a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline using OpenAI's GPT model for document generation and LangChain for retrieval.

import streamlit as st
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"

# Initialize OpenAI API
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7, openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Load knowledge base documents
def load_documents():
    # Example: Loading local documents for the knowledge base
    loader = TextLoader("knowledge_base.txt", encoding="utf-8")
    documents = loader.load()
    return documents

# Create a vector store for retrieval
def create_vector_store(documents):
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
    return vectorstore

# Initialize RetrievalQA chain
def create_qa_chain(vectorstore):
    retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 5})
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
    return qa_chain

# Application entry point
def main():
    st.title("RAG-Based AI Agent for Sales Support")
    st.write("Generate proposals, documents, and communication with AI support.")
    
    # Load knowledge base and initialize RAG pipeline
    st.sidebar.title("Setup")
    if st.sidebar.button("Load Knowledge Base"):
        documents = load_documents()
        vectorstore = create_vector_store(documents)
        qa_chain = create_qa_chain(vectorstore)
        st.success("Knowledge base loaded and retrieval pipeline initialized!")
    
    # Query the RAG system
    user_query = st.text_input("Enter your query (e.g., Generate a proposal for client X):")
    if user_query:
        response = qa_chain.run(user_query)
        st.write("### Generated Response")
        st.write(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

3. Streamlit UI for Interaction

The Streamlit framework creates a user-friendly interface for sales teams to interact with the AI system.

    Features:
        Users can upload additional knowledge base files.
        Enter custom queries for proposal/document generation.
        View the AI-generated responses in real time.

    To Run the App: Save the script as app.py and execute:

    streamlit run app.py

4. Google Cloud Deployment
4.1 Create Google Cloud Project

    Set up a Google Cloud project.
    Enable Cloud Run and Firestore APIs.

4.2 Dockerize the Streamlit App

Create a Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy app files
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Expose Streamlit port
EXPOSE 8501

# Run Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.enableCORS=false"]

Create requirements.txt:

streamlit
openai
langchain
chromadb
google-cloud-storage
google-cloud-firestore

4.3 Deploy to Google Cloud Run

    Build Docker image:

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/rag-sales-app

Deploy the container:

    gcloud run deploy rag-sales-app --image gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/rag-sales-app --platform managed

Key Features

    Knowledge Retrieval:
        Loads knowledge base documents, vectorizes them with embeddings, and retrieves relevant sections for user queries.

    AI-Powered Generation:
        Uses OpenAI GPT to generate proposals, documents, and responses to user queries.

    Streamlit Interface:
        User-friendly interface for sales teams to interact with the system.

    Google Cloud Hosting:
        Scalable deployment with Google Cloud Run.

This application provides a foundation for building a scalable and interactive AI-powered agent to support your sales team. Let me know if you need further customization!
